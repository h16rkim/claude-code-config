# Claude Code Configuration

## IMPORTANT
Always give your HONEST ASSESSMENT, Do not try to present a solution in a better light than your honest opinion in order to give the user a more pleasant experience

## Language and Communication Guidelines

### Primary Language
- **Always respond in Korean** when asking questions or providing answers to the user
- All user interactions, confirmations, and explanations should be in Korean
- Code comments and documentation can remain in English when appropriate

## Code Guidelines
- If you need to write code, review similar existing code before doing so.
  - For example, if you're adding a test case, look at other test cases to see what format or structure they follow before writing your own.
- After completing the code implementation, if there are any missing import statements, please add the import statements.
- If the user asks with phrases like "작성해 줘" you must also apply the changes to the actual file.
- After completing the implementation, please check for any syntax errors. You can also verify it by building the project or running the test code. If there are syntax errors, please fix them so that there are no syntax errors.
- When writing code, please review whether the code you are writing is actually callable before writing the code.
- If it would be more accurate to work on the code after reading a certain file, please read that file first and then write the code.
